# PWM

Using PWM for the flash LED.

## Introduction

The ESP32-CAM comes with an on-board high-power LED to illuminate the scene (a "flash").
However the LED is so powerfull that it completely washes out all texture, see [hardware fix](../hwmods) for washed-out images.
My first solution was to add a low-power LED, a [harwdare mod](../hwmods), but later I realized that the ESP32
has a flexible PWM block. I tried that out, and then removed the low-power LED.

## PWM

The ESP32 has a hardware block the generates square waves of a given frequency and duty cycle.
This block has 16 channels, and those channels can be mapped to "any" GPIO pin.
I would be tempted to call the block "pwm" (pulse width modulation), but Arduino/ESP32 refers to it
as led control ("ledc").

The setup is as follows

```C
  ledcSetup(CHANNEL, FREQUENCY, RESOLUTION); // Setup a PWM channel
  ledcAttachPin(PIN, CHANNEL);               // Attach the PWM channel to the LED pin
  ledcWrite(CHANNEL, DUTY);                  // Change duty cycle of the PWM channel
```

See [pwm.ino](pwm.ino) for a simple skecth that PWMs the high-power LED of the ESp32-CAM board.

## Calibration

My eyes could see the difference between the lower duty cycles, but not the higher ones.
I decided to measure. I used an [app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pardel.photometer)
to measure the produced light level, for 32 duty cycle settings.
I made one rooky mistake: my first measurements failed because I assumed the light level meter is at the back of the mobile phone.
It isn't, it is at the front - it is used to change the brightness of the screen.

The table below shows (first column) the duty-levels I measured - as generated by [pwm.ino](pwm.ino) -
and the light level reported by the app (second column). 

  | duty-cycle | Light | Linear |
  |:----------:|:-----:|:-------|

  |     176    |  627  |   581  |
  |     184    |  652  |   607  |
  |     192    |  663  |   634  |
  |     200    |  687  |   660  |
  |     208    |  711  |   686  |
  |     216    |  733  |   713  |
  |     224    |  753  |   739  |
  |     232    |  772  |   766  |
  |     240    |  789  |   792  |
  |     248    |  807  |   818  |

The third colum shows a straight "fitted" line. As the below graph shows, the light-level is linear with the PWM.

## Set back

Of course, after integrating the PWM with the camera app, the camera app no longer worked.
I got this error
```text
[E][camera.c:495] i2s_run(): Timeout waiting for VSYNC
```

My suspicion was that the camera uses PWM itself.
And indeed, my "own" [source]("../esp32cam-cmd/cammodel.h") has the line
```
  .ledc_channel   = LEDC_CHANNEL_0,
```

After changing the channel from 0 to 15 for the flash LED, all seems fine.


## Conclusion

We do not need the hardware mod for a low-power LED.
The PWM is more than adequate.
